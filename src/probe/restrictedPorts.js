/**
 * Chromium's restricted-port list (kRestrictedPorts in
 * net/base/port_util.cc). Requests to these ports are blocked before any
 * network I/O — fetch fails with ERR_UNSAFE_PORT and ICE candidates to
 * them are killed at the P2P socket layer — so they are reported as
 * "restricted" without probing.
 *
 * Chromium additionally enforces a second, server-pushed blocklist for
 * localhost (kRestrictAbusePortsOnLocalhost, enabled by default, contents
 * not in the source tree) which this static copy cannot account for.
